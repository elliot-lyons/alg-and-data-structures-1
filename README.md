# alg-and-data-structures-1
Code I wrote for my algorithms and data structure 1 module in year 2 semester 1 of my degree.

For assignment 1 I made a simple algorithm that counts collinear points in an array. I made a brute-force version and a binary-search version of the algorithm to demonstrate the difference in run times

Assignment 2 deals with doubly linked lists. I had to implement the standard methods of a doubly linked list, as well as implement methods to give the list stack and queue functionality.

Assignment 3 looks at binary search trees. I implemented the 'height', 'median', 'delete', 'printKeysInOrder' and 'prettyPrintKeys' method.

Bonus Assignment was a special assignment that looked at solving both postfix and infix notation. I also implemented methods that convert between the two.


All zip files include the algorithms for the problems as well as JUnit tests for the methods within the algorithms.
